## Types of variables

### Rand Type
The **Rand** Type selects random values between the smallest value and largest value indicated. 

If no arguments are given within the squared brackets, then the defaults will take effect.  


so
```
add values = rand[]
```
is equivalent to
```
add values =rand[
    min = 1,
    max = 10,
    type = int,
    weights = [],
    amount =1
]
```
